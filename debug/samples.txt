1 i 've come to appreciate from mac laptops .
0 or the $t$ has been updated probably 400 times , the same time .
1 i wish iwork or ms office came with the best photo application i have had no problems , very frustrating and very disappointing .
0 i get a $t$ . . i love the easy to learn to use $t$ and speedy
0 the $t$ . . it is of no good and i dont want it too .
0 the $t$ will start having issues .
1 i was even more thrilled to learn of programs like $t$ , not $t$ , wonderful $t$ and with free $t$ and business use .
0 thanks for the average laptop out there , but the ease of use , despite all its so called laptop $t$ pretty well .
0 great laptop that offers many great programs , using the laptop is outstanding in all the viruses associated with $t$ there are no different from pcs ' with $t$ but i am a slow typist -rrb- or if he spoke english .
0 the start menu is not covered by the trackpad make $t$ around .
0 since i bought it , from $t$ and with a flawless $t$ . -rrb-
1 i did see $t$ crashing and it runs just fine .
0 also ... - excellent operating system files .
0 the $t$ . -rrb-
1 until i bought my mac is wonderful , it 's own , like my mbp ... once used to , so much more $t$ . . stable . . it is easy to use and are quick to start up .
0 for me .
0 it is very easy to navigate and $t$ of this machine .
0 there is a bit of an antiquated cpu and thus no way to slow down occassionally but can run all the design of the more robust versions of these programs on a pc user my whole life , and the $t$ soon came off , i love hp , , , , , eventually i got my teenage son one , because it had the same windows update has appeared on this thing is that if you purchase new $t$ . -rrb-
0 i bought my netbook from .
0 in addition , all the other features i was use to on a mac version of , like all the expected features and more + plus a wide $t$ and i do n't have to break off -lrb- even when you wonder whether your computer takes few seconds , shutdown in 2-4 seconds , shutdown in 2-4 seconds , even for those who are just pretty to $t$ . . extremely fast and easy with mac the size because the $t$ . . i love the size and look is the $t$ with no problem for me , they come loose .
0 performance is much ahead from the $t$ stopped working -lrb- 3 months and it works well , other than not being a corrupted version of macbook pro , especially if you do n't like about apples is they generally use safari but after many years of using $t$ , good quality and $t$ . -rrb-
0 i bought my mac .
0 the macbook is so much more streamlined system for adding $t$ , iweb , itunes , garageband -rrb- is all very helpful as well .
0 either the computer is the $t$ when it does n't seem to be very good $t$ for my supposedly bluetooth enabled computer , my macbook pro notebook will make it worth the money -rrb- , imail -lrb- which can incorporate with the $t$ and was pretty self
1 $t$ is all new again so you can do with the same cheap material as the average laptop out the wifi card and replace it , such as half-life 2 or even been slightly
1 the $t$ are terrific , including the iphoto .
0 i 've have n't tried the $t$ after that i have has had issues with the $t$ is not functioning .
0 the large $t$ and excellent battery life , largest hard drive the $t$ , now it works well and i was set from the mac mini has a $t$ but after 1 week it stopped openning web pages .
0 but see the macbook as it is ideal for portability and fast processing !!!
0 yeah , of course , i got a replacement .
0 i know vista is n't perfect about this laptop and willing to spend a little much , but i needed a new system called windows 7 , photoshop etc -rrb- !
1 the $t$ to slow down occassionally but can run all the $t$ would change for some reason i was stuck until $t$ came with the trackpad i would have cost more than satisfied .
0 this is a great little computer for anything like graphics editing and post production , so many cool features .
0 long story , but even if apple does decides to lower and there is only one set on the market .
1 amazing $t$ for longer than one hour and within two months , the case is coming apart , and you lose whatever you were working on , it 's now all $t$ were standard .
0 even so , i do some surfing , email , ms office does n't keep up with a lot more solid than apple 's $t$ are good for a very badly designed system , to locking up and ready to go out and buy new $t$ makes a hollow sound when using the mouse command buttons .
1 it 's ok but the $t$ . . it is small -lrb- especially for a bit loose -lrb- when you buy it at a time if you 're gaming -rrb- .
1 first the $t$ it made the computer is good $t$ , but no led
0 i also had a more powerful $t$ and that other $t$ i was told that the $t$ again , it 's kinda of
0 oh yeah , of course bought a $t$ . . i love every single bit about it .
0 the best of both worlds with all the $t$ could be a bigger hard drive is and how it $t$ well and i love this particular mac because of $t$ as was told that my warranty had expired -lrb- 2 days old -rrb- and that is n't the entire issue because my latest purchase was my acer and it works great , the product sent and so they installed a new intel core processors and had a problem with this yet so to me after many calls and complaints about their products .
0 the screen has a sloppy bluetooth interface -lrb- courtesy of the battery icon would read , for example , `` 74 % , unlike pc laptops which drop more than the laptop is fantastic .
0 not sure if you are $t$ that do n't even get a new $t$ is too slick .
0 after that one ended as well .
0 the flaws are , this model , i took it out of pocket $t$ is absolutely horrible to use , although it did n't work with $t$ but wo n't increase to a full-inch margin that is n't even come with $t$ so much simpler , quicker , and because of the cheap laptop with $t$ . . now i have found it very easy for someone used to as some of the laptop -lrb- i have only had it for 1098 + tax - 1070 - otd !
1 also ... - excellent $t$ -lrb- ati 5870 -rrb- / 8gb ram / $t$ . . it is a machine to do some $t$ , etc. .
1 i like the tired $t$ -rrb- .
0 while it was wonderful that there may be .
0 i work as a 15 '' but the screen is big enough -lrb- this was my acer and it is easy to use the $t$ is so easy to use when using headphones/mic , not the full software that you absolutely can not be an issue $t$ many times .
0 the macbook pro is a great product , great delivery , and when it did not listen and i did see $t$ crashing and it is quick to start up it asks for a very disappointing .
0 this version of macbook pro , the $t$ and firefox , msn messenger and a bigger screen .
1 the best thing to $t$ on the main hard drive -lrb- i have in the computer , the apparent security , the bluetooth to work properly , so far i 've fixed the dc jack -lrb- inside the unit -rrb- , imail -lrb- which is good .
0 i also did n't offer any $t$ because i do n't feel comfortable doing it yourself , just certain things .
0 the design , the $t$ does not have a built-in mic , not $t$ as i do n't have to reset the computer .
0 while i am recently myself
1 i am pleased with the amount of memory .
0 we love the solid $t$ , but you must get the correct $t$ -lrb- i should have waited the few months or so months the $t$ , and customer service .
0 as a graphic artist run poorly .
0 was disappointed to find and
0 we love the $t$ screams , and if thats not bad enough it does n't shut -rrb- that could be better off getting a $t$ or something but
0 it has any more issues after the $t$ is a huge computer person i love the $t$ that comes with wireless apple keyboard and the ram -lrb- the $t$ will end up lasting a lot of cool software included with the hard drive went bad and it runs just fine .
0 great value for that matter .
0 we have had it for -lrb- internet , $t$ , they paid
0 after all $t$ were shorting out anytime i touched the lid .
0 i 've already had my laptop and when i got it and would n't even come with $t$ . . stable . . it is a breeze .
0 now i 'm still within the one year $t$ but , for i was stuck until windows 7 starter and not flashing as it is made out of a tablet , without the user 's liking .
0 it 's hard for me -lrb- i have found it fine to work everyday and this one is
1 it also comes with a mac , look at , the $t$ and that the $t$ are terrible and are quick to process this computer does not have a lot faster !
0 that included the extra money to spend a little over an hour and within two months , stopped holding a charge , which really eliminates the need to run my $t$ flashed and lost everything on it to friend who temporarily fixed it by using the $t$ has no hard drive . -rrb-
0 because we did not $t$ '' how can a company that makes the use of fun using the external keyboard , and its weight is fantasic .
1 the ilife software that comes with free $t$ and benefits to the high standard i 've seen in a new or repaired machine approximately 3 weeks later i had to call apple support to set up my new toshiba $t$ great , the initial out of the blue the $t$ . -rrb-
0 i 'm looking forward to
0 we also use $t$ and i do some $t$ . . i love the operating system .
1 i can say is that it could not open the $t$ . . extremely fast and reliable .
0 it was a self ejecting $t$ this is a three year warranty and the $t$ will stay the same problem so now i 'm using mine right now hoping the $t$ . . it is very easy to $t$ . -rrb-
1 if you are taking a bit of an external power supply .
0 while most people say that pcs hold functionality and value and macs are just pretty to $t$ , network and printers was all that was worth the $t$ . . it is fast , easy to $t$ at all .
0 all the flexibility that comes with this computer is so slow , it has just enough $t$ for beginners and musicians at the same windows update , i made a photo book as a computer that i can take full advantage of the benefits i love the $t$ will slowly less and less impressive laptop , making it very easy to carry because of their products were more reliable to
0 i '
1 $t$ was great for general internet use , has a killer $t$ , standard email the form and fax in multiple documents .
0 biggest complaint is the $t$ i was also able to find lap top and the $t$ gets so hot it is easy to use and it barely adds any $t$ or product .
0 i am pleased with the performance and shortening battery
1 i just chose to hide the message .
0 upgrading from windows 7 , what about us vista users ? they should get all the functions works great with my iphone helped me get used to learning and getting used to them .
0 they do n't feel comfortable doing it yourself , just for school or office use -lrb- pages , numbers -rrb- have an option to save you $ 10
0 very nice and smooth $t$ . . -rrb-
0 but there 's literally no way of tracking it to my writing and was aluminum style -rrb- which had a 10 % off coupon from amazon-cost me 998 plus tax - plus i had always used pcs and been constantly
0 i would change on it .
1 it $t$ fine , and without the user 's liking .
1 that included the extra sony sonic stage software , are also most attractive .
0 first , macbook pro never has an issue running many many applications -lrb- ie internet
1 this is not exactly technologically advanced to learn to use buttons to click again !
0 although i have ever owned .
1 the most important $t$ of the imac mc309ll/a on amazon is at $ 900 + level only , and if the $t$ and they replaced the awesome ergonomic small lightweight power supply .
0 so in a very disappointing experience except that it was sent back in to toshiba some complaints and three weeks after i supplied serial number in order to take advantage of this hp laptop .
1 that included the extra money to jump up to the high standard i 've been impressed with the $t$ are crisp and clean .
0 -rrb- and put the $t$ . -rrb-
0 it 's so nice that the portability , longevity , and has been updated probably 400 times , the $t$ is just one of the line $t$ and they went through it and it runs a lot of video , listen to music from a pc person , i find that the priviledge of $t$ is completely
0 the $t$ , longevity , and ease of $t$ five days a week i finally had everything running with all the $t$ is rubbing off the button below the mouse pad .
1 not only are the things you can take full advantage of this machine has the $t$ of the size and increases the $t$ . . stable . . -rrb-
0 externally the $t$ is plastic and makes a hollow sound when using headphones/mic , not $t$ . . fast . . it is a great little computer for anything i

1 another three weeks later i had to buy the $t$ again so you can do with the power and $t$ quickly , runs fast etc. .
0 i have all the other plastic
0 now $t$ is more for the lower end of the screen , good price-point , nice appearance , $t$ -lrb- but that was required .
0 they replaced the $t$ is bright and clear , the speakers and the short battery life of just over 2 years .
0 its ease of use -rrb- which was frustrating .
1 that included the extra money to me .
0 all of the $t$ and the $t$ -lrb- $ 400 old hp laptop .
0 it was over two minutes .
0 was very easy to $t$ and that probably
0 os x like windows .
1 returned laptop for the $t$ is not exactly technologically advanced to learn that i never want to use and love all you can make an

0 wonderful $t$ . . now i had to have the best of any pc $t$ : excellent , the dvd drive soon came off , after a few other applications constantly at the store - only on the computer in .
0 we also use two
0 the $t$ would have cost more : they played games with me -rrb- on load - very quiet - i could ask for .
1 apple has a 10 hour battery life , lack of a webcam , its keyboard easily accommodates large hands , and the $t$ was .
1 i wiped nearly everything off of it .

0 we also use $t$ to jump all over the $t$ was great for those that switch from a notebook expecting the $t$ is amazing , the book has no $t$ on the market for an $t$ unnecessary -lrb- unless you want a little dark to see how long the $t$ is not that responsive to
1 this is likely due to the new editions gives you the option to save you $ 10
1 fan only comes on when you turn up the $t$ this laptop again i am not sure on $t$ , but as it is the most important features of any kind of ... limited .
0 i had been a windows update has appeared on this computer works as if brand new and $t$ is only for a change and tired of the larger macbook pros for heavy duty $t$ -rrb- and after 8 months , stopped holding a $t$ so when you are doing any website work , you get what you wanted -lrb- $t$ -rrb- then they finally gave in .
0 i 've had to call hp and ask for .
0 the price of it , you ll discover that the plastic piece inside had broken -lrb- $t$ , so i immediately put $t$ in about 30 seconds which is useful for designers .
0 the $t$ to keep this computer make me -lrb- even after installing new $t$ ? as i am for sure purchasing another 13 '' macbook pro never has an issue , but has a large $t$ is coming apart , and it is lightweight and the sound card in may i got -lrb- that was loaded with all the $t$ was .
1 just a webcam , its got the added $t$ that i am used to build my own desktop and really cool default background .
1 i just chose to hide the message .
0 i love the $t$ is good it just works out of $t$ and iwork is cheap compared to windows 7 ultimate , and my core applications that i had to send the laptop is definitely a good two hours .
0 features such as certain times $t$ loads but claims to not be using that $t$ . -rrb-

0 i have had nothing but constant break
0 in fact it had no record of me having the 3 year $t$ but the features it is easy to use when using headphones/mic , not due to a dell laptop and bad customer services i received my replacement , i paid a

0 i respond that i have never had this computer is good .
0 worse , try finding $t$ , though i miss is that you absolutely can not be able to buy one for under $ 1000
1 other than it 's fast , it is fast $t$ and it seemed as though none of the more robust versions of these , and the $t$ on the drivers/applications dvd , or the keyboard !
0 i also did not take long to get around , and easy to $t$ on this macbook pro runs on a single $t$ . -rrb-
1 i love the $t$ because they knew $t$ would cost an extra $

1 if you start looking at laptops to stay away from this machine : speed , $t$ in her and i am first time that my dell did with windows 7 starter to win 7 home , and the system would not fix the $t$ had been replaced , so i was extremely happy to be very good pictures with the condition and has fantastic features like the $t$ , final cut pro 7 , photoshop , safari , $t$ , as well , battery life -lrb- yes , that was worth the extra money to spend on one of apple $ 2000 off and even the simple activity of $t$ . . it is easily compatible with $t$ . . extremely fast and i had not been a constant 5 month occurance since i bought my netbook , the same computer for portability and $t$ running at the total cost of ownership , so i need .
0 overall i feel a little bit uncomfortable in using the internet , artwork -rrb- , and also $t$ . -rrb-
0 then the $t$ cause the battery - the new macbook pro laptop allows me to it .
0 it was out of the headphone and mic anytime they went out .
0 the $t$ takes some getting used to the laptop is so much easier to $t$ computer , and great $t$ . . -rrb-

1 $t$ is crystal clear with amazing colors and $t$ more than ten minutes .
1 / awesome cooling system / much better .
0 tried $t$ and it $t$ really well .
0 additionally , there is a bit loose -lrb- when you want more information on the main $t$ . . i love the feel , and is very useful applications like $t$ that comes with a ground loop isolator , but keeps itself
1 it had major heating issues .
1 you can create the perfect memoir for your parents , family , siblings , and the overall $t$ of web pages for me to find any $t$ or working with mac is so easy to use -5 usb ports - runs about 38-41c on idle , up to 65 -lrb- for me when i use it mostly for content creation -lrb- audio , video projects into one $t$ to run all the bugs out of the $t$ never held a $t$ to be connected to the genius bar - can not get help after hours .
0 it also comes with .
1 the only good thing that came out of vista before investing in a nice $t$ . . i love the design . . it is very quick and effective as i am impressed with the os it is made out of vista before investing in a nice $t$ , the i5 macbook pro , quicken , photoshop etc -rrb- !
0 i 'm out of this machine .
0 i love this particular mac because its very fast , powerful , and mouse , all put together , because of this is a bummer .
1 also you may need the $t$ also does n't have a battery life , as well .
1 which it did n't come with most pc users : the $t$ stopped working after the $t$ once they
0 so having the $t$ . . extremely fast and a strong sense of the screen graphics and $t$ is excellent ...
1 asked the $t$ is just a normal $t$ with me because it was over two minutes .
0 i 'm sure an upgrade $t$ would show up some place else .
1 i always use a $t$ to actually learn about computers with .
0 i guess the only drawback .
0 $t$ would n't power on after intalling a $t$ -lrb- up to the laptop was designed for right handed person .
0 the $t$ is bought toshiba will do nothing about it .
1 chatting with $t$ or full $t$ , i do not buy this - do n't always take it with other techs in
0 it has that nice
1 and its weight is fantasic .
1 they replaced the $t$ knew what they were so cheap -rrb- and it also has many applications at once without slowing me down .
0 in addition , there is a little bit away from another country trying to uninstall $t$ , graphic design and its hard to use , very imformative , wonder alerts and tutorials making it perfect for the same cheap $t$ as an $t$ . . i love about my mac is the `` repair '' .
1 another thing i dislike the weight and $t$ so called toshiba where i can dualboot windows .
0 i would have cost more : they played games with me when i went to get $t$ to weight to $t$ , and the $t$ also .
0 it works well , but it comes with very useful applications like $t$ . . now i had to buy more $t$ which i highly recommend .
0 it was also suffering from hardware -lrb- keyboard -rrb- issues , relatively slow performance and quality of $t$ five days a week after my $t$ and even tried to use a tutorial to learn of programs like adobe creative apps
0 sure , the only thing i really do have , is easy to use $t$ and windows xp , $t$ were standard .
1 i would recommend going with a little more than 80 % .
0 it 's $t$ to choose from .
1 so i was extremely pleased to make life easier , unlike pc laptops .
0 the first time .
0 it is pretty easy to use -5 usb ports , 1 sd memory card reader is slightly recessed and upside down -lrb- the $t$ is not working and usb ports .
0 it 's also very portable yet powerful netbook to do ? the lg service center does not affect $t$ at and the $t$ . . now i had was a bonus because of the netbooks but this computer for anything like graphics editing and post production , so i can render the $t$ and shipping !
1 i just plug this into my 22 '' monitor and $t$ makes a hollow sound when using the computer runs very fast , great feature !
1 in november my computer back it went to the fact that my mac because its very fast , powerful , and in terms of gaming and movie playing it 'll have a desktop replacement -rrb- but i like the trackpad i would recomend this to anybody that
0 also , the mac software and the $t$ make pictures i took it to find things about this laptop is equipped with a ground loop isolator , but since they make it well worth the cheap laptop with big $t$ , the extended life battery and the wireless switch it at a great product for a $t$ to go with it which has $t$ in the morning in less than a week for them , but it can be fixed if you need to talk to the $t$ is wonderfull .
0 this is a quad-core 2.5 ghz cpu -lrb- similar to microsoft office -rrb- .
1 but to be a problem with the trackpad is unmatched in product quality , had $t$ replaced at my expense .
0 did not have a desktop replacement -rrb- but i wanted something that had overall great $t$ if you have money to spend a little dark to see if the $t$ as certain times windows loads but claims to not bother getting $t$ expecting it will not be able to $t$ or working with mac the beautiful screen , in case it gets plugged into the college life , wonderful $t$ . . i love the $t$ do help .
0 $t$ i 'd like is for the way it is cheap plastic and makes a hollow sound when using headphones/mic , not to say , my $t$ would many times not power down without a forced
0 even though this has been updated probably 400 times , the $t$ is a great product , very pleased with the high effeciency setting the $t$ on it it asks for a quality laptop and would n't play a dvd now .
0 it has a killer $t$ , the $t$ and it worked okay for a more efficient way to slow .
0 - called
0 i have the power supply that weighed more than big enough -lrb- this could be a perfect laptop if it was the best program i have , is easy to $t$ ! . . it is a charge for more information on the hard drive . -rrb-
0 within a year of buying it before i bought it for web browsing and word editing , making it very easy to work with mac is that sony
0 am very happy with my purchase of the macbook pro is a little much , but the $t$ to be the only fact i dont like about my mac is just one .
0 screen , great computer $t$ extremely slowly , whether
1 it 's because when you go through the $t$ itself so you might as well save the money it $t$ very reasonable and $t$ : mail , research , etc. -rrb- , music -lrb- garageband -rrb- , the computer and works great with my phone and camera .
1 its the best $t$ i wanted including a vga port so i recommend getting a $t$ so i kind of ... limited .
0 i highly recommend .
0 either the computer and works great for the many years .
0 the 13 '' macbook -lrb- had pro specs and while
1 it 's super fast and has better $t$ . . fast . . i love its solid build , light , and the $t$ is easy to use , and many other features .
0 -rrb- i was told the motherboard and some fan inside .
1 it was `` bundled '' with extra software , options , it gets broken , have to direct my concern to the key combination rather than the worth of the pc formatting , but i use the $t$ was still working , but when fully charged shows only 7 hours of $t$ ... seems kind of $t$ , it 's incredibly slow .
0 $t$ is not working and $t$ are very good $t$ . -rrb-
0 the store - only on the surface : 17 '' inch screen , as i do n't make it worth the money -rrb- , music -lrb- garageband -rrb- is all very helpful as well for work , you can with newer pc 's keyboard took a few other applications live up to the $t$ is a great $t$ if you want gaming on the track pad , awesome thinking apple !
0 also you may need the performance seems quite good , i really do like my big 16 '' laptop does .
0 also , one of the $t$ which is advertised as a replacement which i bought it for me .
1 tech support and got the new $t$ -rrb- would not load .
1 and the $t$ are on the ipod and ipad -rrb- , photo management -lrb- photo booth , $t$ and microsoft is dropping $t$ next april .
0 it has easy to $t$ was terrific .
1 fast , great delivery , and great graphics for the computing she 's doing -lrb- internet , and $t$ well without having to deal with your problems by constantly
0 love the $t$ . . -rrb-
0 while i am for sure purchasing another 13 '' macbook -lrb- had pro specs and while
0 sure , the $t$ would crash all the typing that i wanted the pro , the speakers and the images comes very clear , the keyboard , mouse , and the $t$ , and it even comes with .
0 the latest version does not hold full charge .
1 ease of use with the $t$ was great .
0 the most feature that attracted me to unplug the external keyboard , and doing other things everyone does on a desk in front of them spoke english .
1 - bluetooth -lrb- 2.1 -rrb- , video-editing or movie-making -lrb- imovie -rrb- , and $t$ are in front of you it looks great .
1 because we did not track in core processing unit
0 it does not have all the viruses associated with it -lrb- very
1 the dv4 boasted a faster processor , more memory , lots of very good , working well so far .
1 there was none .
0 the battery life -lrb- of about 2 more hours -rrb- .
1 it has a comfortble keyboard -lrb- no you ca n't company 's like dell who allow you to convert your pc documents into readable files on macs i suggest going to like it much easier than any computer is very useful for time machine .
0 speaking of the benefits i love the $t$ has not been a issue for me -rrb- on load - very quiet , actually the $t$ , who
0 but see the $t$ -lrb- including garageband -rrb- , and when i bought the dell , i was looking too
1 the computer much easier to $t$ , or it will not be able to be reasonably portable .
1 this one was very pleased with the computer runs very fast , $t$ as the first one , because of the unique way that apple osx 16 functions , most of all i can say is that it is also made better , my battery life , largest $t$ and the ilife software that comes with a x in the dark at night .
0 it is of high $t$ . . extremely fast and has to be able to run windows via bootcamp for the price was great for this computer is very large and crystal clear with amazing colors and resolution .
0 the real stand out on me , the $t$ make up for it , as i soon discovered , though , then you are using this for document creation apple doesnt provide any kind of word processor -lrb- such as ilife , $t$ is very easy for someone used to , has a 10 hour battery life when you 're doing $t$ and whatnot , but this one was very pleased with the office programs as well .
0 $t$ has a new one .
0 great $t$ . -rrb-
0 $t$ is included .
0 it was caused by physical abuse and is absolutely gorgeous .
0 the only problem that they can make the $t$ is wonderful , it 's also very easy to use , $t$ , a mac is much much better speakers on the side , so far .
0 the only downfall is a feature where i can render the device .
1 overall : poor , features : average , performance : poor , $t$ , build .
0 i was a self ejecting slot this would not be beat .
0 came fully $t$ - integrated mic/webcam * - dual touchpad mode is interesting , and above average for gaming .
0 the computer was light weight , i 'll remove the card reader is slightly recessed and upside down -lrb- the thing that you absolutely can not change your $t$ will start having issues .
0 after replacing the $t$ of web pages for me -rrb- on occasion and $t$ . . it is made of the computer runs very quiet too which is great because i do not support it .
0 in may but they more than 5 minutes for a very badly designed system , to find things about this notebook i do n't make windows xp , $t$ is very weak and the latest $t$ the battery would only last me on average about 2.5 to 3 hours .
0 i actually had the $t$ really out does itself .
0 it absolutely is more for the price , i was very easy for anyone with an $t$ and it came back with obvious physical damage -lrb- keyboard bulging and speaker grill pressed in -rrb- , photo editing -rrb- and it had no record of me having the $t$ : excellent , and a bigger future problem .
1 but it has such great $t$ ! . . i love the editing capabilities -rrb- , video-editing or movie-making -lrb- imovie -rrb- , etc. .
1 do yourself a perfectly decent laptop .
1 $t$ included with the laptop loads in 15-20 seconds .
0 screen , great netbook , low $t$ . . -rrb-
0 the screen .
0 fully $t$ - i could go on and on two of the laptop .
1 a great thing , this will be my second one and pounding .
0 the screen is a little getting used to , has a sloppy $t$ -lrb- up to 65 -lrb- for me when i upgrade my $t$ and shipping !
1 the $t$ . . stable . . stable . . it is worth the extra money to spend a little much , but is fun and a $t$ or ms office came with the $t$ is fantasic .
0 $t$ has a fantastic display , is small and light , and my core applications that i could do the change it .
0 a lot of the battery - the functions .
0 i got the computer much easier to $t$ and was told , was a bit .
0 i reloaded with $t$ . . i love the easy to $t$ and i could go on and feels solid , with a few bucks and upgrade to one of the internal problems , though , you ca n't company 's like $t$ . . now i 'm taking this year , and the $t$ to and from hp and they narcissist genius bar staff -rrb- fixed it and they did replace the $t$ . . now i 'd highly recommend this computer for light $t$ and since i 'm using mine right now hoping the $t$ rather than the netbook , so that i bought my netbook from .
1 this is unlikely as i like how the edges on the surface : 17 '' inch screen , this computer is good value if you work in real time .
0 the $t$ expires the power supply will start having issues .
0 in due course , i am running $t$ ? as i go and could use a mac are
1 a key
1 we paid for $t$ , iweb , itunes , email , facebook , pictures and music software is nowhere close to professional grade $t$ im used to , but i 'm learning $t$ . . it is small and light , but that should come with most pc laptops , but $t$ and sealed in the macbook arrived in a room with any background activity .
1 the programs that are faster , better-configured , and fax in multiple documents .
1 the $t$ to the multi touch gestures this operating system .
0 the $t$ . . fast . . i love the $t$ itself is very intuitive , so no cooling pad needed , great !
0 i also love the $t$ , nice $t$ . . it is a brand new laptop but in comparison to a mac is just too slow to $t$ , speed and power i could ever expect from a major $t$
0 there are $t$ that i have never had this kind of money on something has less features than the average laptop , replaced the $t$ would n't power on after intalling a windows / $t$ plus network connection on left make for a great program for anyone with an external mouse unnecessary -lrb- unless you 're like me you want more information on the hard drive , my mac .
0 apparently well - $t$ and keep my
0 i was completely wrong , this set up my new toshiba $t$ great and is well worth $ 2
0 this is a great product , very imformative , wonder alerts and tutorials making it perfect for work , you ll discover that hp -lrb- what i was considering buying the actual and works just as well .
1 they went out we were looking at the intermediate level .
0 it has easy to $t$ and does not $t$ '' -rrb- $t$ that we could send you back making you feel that only boots the $t$ is silky smooth !
1 but other than that its a good value , well worth it .
0 it is easy to configure for
0 $t$ is good $t$ and it even has a lot more memory and replaced the $t$ , ethernet and 3 usb ports .
1 though the picture , $t$ , and would constandly have to keep on lap .
0 however , the multi-touch gestures and large $t$ . . stable . . fast . . i love windows 7 with a flawless $t$ . . extremely fast and easy to use the serial number the first time i used itunes -lrb- which is a plus .
0 fully $t$ - i was now on the pro for the same for the money and just purchase $t$ , full 1920x1080 screen - integrated mic/webcam * - dual touchpad mode is interesting , and fun multi-touch mouse is worth the money .
0 i have has had issues with the os more than big enough $t$ to the existing line bumping up the processor is very weak and the experience in mac .
1 yes , they cost more to fix the $t$ is a reason for which similarly-configured sony and toshiba machines cost more : they use higher-quality components that are quite cheap or free .
0 this is n't $
0 i called sony the $t$ is going darker , darker , darker , darker , darker .
0 reason why ? it 's not light and easy to operate and i never tried any $t$ . . it is sent for repair a 2nd time and it looks more than the netbook 's hinge is a little more custom
0 i have several great $t$ , storage , a great product , great $t$ ! -rrb- .
0 the $t$ , network and printers was all that great $t$ . -rrb-
0 it has a better quality web cam , just for school or office use -lrb- pages , such as word or excel .
1 i previously purchased a toshiba lap top and the smoothness of the box ready ; appearance and functionality .
0 the 13 '' macbook -lrb- had pro specs and while
1 i am so happy with this laptop is definitely amazing for high performance to handle more stuff at once and $t$ quickly , runs fast etc. .
1 despite the claims of the features i was in new condition and has been updated probably 400 times , they want you to place various connections all around the $t$ -rrb- .
0 it 's poor $t$ , keyboard , long battery life , lack of support for games .
1 like the mini form factor , all the $t$ are n't bad at all .
0 summary : they played games with me and finally the $t$ at , i had to have the best i 've had in the dark at night which
0 sony parts
0 i would not fix it if it translates at all .
1 in the dark at night and
0 it is quick to start up .
0 its office compatible , which is useful for time machine .
0 great battery life is too short , the $t$ of just over 5 hours .
0 then just the other $t$ makes the use more easy .
1 overall , this set up , then do not recomend anything bigger except for $t$ . -rrb-
0 i wanted and everything is ready to take it with me because my latest purchase was my means of communication with my purchase of the battery holds up well , other than it 's because when you wonder whether your computer takes few seconds , shutdown in 2-4 seconds , shutdown in 2-4 seconds , even though this has been updated probably 400 times , they blame me for installing a bad connector with the built-in camera .
0 - bluetooth -lrb- 2.1 -rrb- , photo management -lrb- photo booth , iphoto -rrb- , the $t$ and multiple at a time if you understand what i would like to have my hd flashed and lost everything on it 's a decent computer for word processing , graphic design and its replacement worked for less then two months , out of the laptop is definitely a decent laptop that lasted more than make up for it 's very frustrating and very easy to $t$ it once a day , if you need is a huge bonus and $t$ . -rrb-

1 it 's just beautiful .
0 theres also $t$ , the $t$ of any pc i have ever owned ...
1 reason why ? it 's been just fine and like the loud $t$ it is easy to $t$ , more memory on the $t$ has a comfortble $t$ -lrb- in pc enabled with $t$ , and when the $t$ that allow for quicker browsing of web pages .
0 the dv4 boasted a faster processor and more $t$ and a few other $t$ constantly overheats , the same for the $t$ fell apart right after the $t$ froze again .
0 which is advertised as a graphic artist run poorly .

0 os x like windows .
1 i run dreamweaver , final cut pro 7 , what about us $t$ users .
0 $t$ went bad after 2 hours it did n't $t$ when it did n't even worth the money -rrb- , $t$ , the $t$ this is the price along with some of the best to type on .
1 i 'm already hooked on the internet .
1 i noticed windows has always been second nature to me alone .
0 i bought the dell , i like those programs better than office and you lose whatever you were working on , also , the $t$ is included .
0 i paid for $t$ / linux user before this -rrb- i was led to the $t$ was completely wrong , this mac mini .
0 but , buy this computer make me -lrb- i have upgraded to lion , so it was plugged in -lrb- mousing over the screen size would change for some reason i was now on the hard drive , or at the same size $t$ . . it is fast and runs a $t$ with mac and it was poorly put together in neat and organized icon

0 so happy i bought it , as easy as it is small -lrb- especially for a 3rd repair and it runs just fine .
0 i will never know about the $t$ is running $t$ ? as i do not have .
1 there is $t$ that allow you to place various connections all around the computer and its reliable .
1 also , the $t$ is just so much more streamlined $t$ for the $t$ on the ipod and ipad -rrb- , video-editing or movie-making -lrb- imovie -rrb- , if you 're all set .
0 there is nothing to complain about the $t$ was running .
0 it had was that the battery life when you wonder whether your computer instead of 320gb -rrb- but time has taught me never to trust an $t$ , it 's so nice not to worry about $t$ issues , at least play cd 's when i realized that the priviledge of talking to a mac until this started
0 it has 3 $t$ . . it is running snow leopard o/s is extremely stable , is extremely easy to $t$ and hated it !!!
0 despite the claims of the unique way that apple $t$ functions , most acer laptop $t$ . -rrb-
0 also , if for medium use every thing fast and a great $t$ , email , chat , download a video , and the bluetooth mouse for my supposedly bluetooth enabled computer , but i wanted a computer that i am not sure if i was not repaired when it comes with .
0 the $t$ of a computer that $t$ just `` slide '' down , and the fact that you can even run a $t$ , which i am used to my wireless system would not do 1-to-1 exchange and i was a breeze .
0 i like the $t$ of a macbook ?
0 the material this pro is made of the $t$ a bit under $ 50 for it , from $t$ -lrb- 4 -rrb- , music -lrb- garageband -rrb- is excellent , the mini 's $t$ are always
0 but to be able to be said about the simplicity , the dvd drive firewire port -lrb- will work with mac the beautiful screen , and longevity .
1 the $t$ is terrific .
0 i ` have had another mac , the $t$ - so you will not show after the $t$ i have used a computer that i had a 10 hour battery life -lrb- of about 2 months now and found no issues with power supply problem and come up when you 're like me who is not good .
1 i love $t$ but the casing looks like i will $t$ myself -lrb- because with this computer are also very capable of doing moderate video editing -lrb- although you may need to , because it may have a bad connector with the hard drive , and ease of use -rrb- which was frustrating .
1 still under $t$ . . extremely fast and has fantastic features like the $t$ so called laptop $t$ will end up lasting a lot of cool apps .
1 summary : they use higher-quality components that are quite cheap or free .
0 the ati graphics card . . i love the $t$ and i ca n't company 's like $t$ and great $t$ ! -rrb- .
0 purchased for
0 they say that pcs hold functionality and value and macs are just pretty to $t$ during one of my customers .
0 the bluetooth and fingerprint reader -lrb- $t$ , which i should n't , check the `` activity monitor ''
0 i wish that the word processing , and were looking for and it even comes with it one month out of country .
0 this laptop has only 2 $t$ * - dual touchpad mode is interesting , and i am using is easier to create a $t$ covering all the software and $t$ . . -rrb-
0 i know $t$ is dead !
1 the mini to be said about the simplicity of macs .
0 i am old school and hate the pad , but ms office came with it it started out by randomly ceasing to charge when it comes with some of the $t$ . . fast . . i love the editing capabilities -rrb- , etc. -rrb- , it does n't keep up with good looking products .
0 also ... - excellent operating system - size and look is the 15 inch macbook pro and it works great !
1 the $t$ almost looked like a charm .
0 a cheaper and less impressive laptop , and the fingerprint reader , full 1920x1080 screen - integrated mic/webcam * - dual touchpad mode is interesting , and even better with lower $t$ , and since i keyboard over 100 wpm , i am fully satisfied with the address book on the $t$ . -rrb-
0 in fact i dont want it too has problems .
0 however i chose two day $t$ and more $t$ . -rrb-
0 i 'm using this mac .
0 i paid a
0 excellent $t$ . . fast . . i love this particular mac because of this product .
1 came with iphoto and $t$ . -rrb-
1 after a few uses the paint is rubbing off the battery icon would read , for all the design and ease of $t$ and they narcissist genius bar - can not be without it for email , facebook , pictures and music .
0 the battery but wo n't ever go back to $t$ , are also most attractive .
1 i upgraded it 's own , like all the other plastic
0 i will have to purchase this laptop has only 2 $t$ * , 16gb ram . . it is a netbook although i was looking too
1 needs longer lasting $t$ , well worth the extra money to spend a little slow , it 's not just the other features i wanted something that had a 10 hour battery life , lack of support for games .
1 the $t$ because the screen , so much better grafics card -lrb- this could be more durable .
0 also , because of $t$ and have had it for -lrb- internet , and because of the display is only a $t$ . . now i have already ordered more $t$ for the musicians , and their $t$ is simply
0 they also use two
0 i also purchased iwork to go with it .
1 going to need to add another os x is solid with lots of hard drive , but has a killer gui , is the motherboard chip that lets the cpu talk to the apple store and they have a battery life was supposed to do homework more ;
0 the $t$ issues but they more than the previous comment that $t$ -rrb- i love this particular mac because of their $t$ could use a $t$ , nicer screen , good $t$ and boy
0 the $t$ and not flashing as it is short on space , and the latest $t$ the book was of perfect
1 screen , and the system constantly overheats , the product they want to bother them with bright lighting , it 's so wonderful .
1 the only downfall is a great $t$ , and doing other things , when this happens you ca n't company 's like dell who allow you to convert was the $t$ screams , and the my toshiba satellite has been dropping as fast as i am with their $t$ and be happy , plus a wide screen and crashing everytime i booted it .
0 first things first , it would be perfect !
0 and the $t$ is really easy to $t$ . . i love the $t$ are n't familiar with a power supply and shortly after warrenty expires the power plug has to be in good working microphone , good quality and good $t$ and the images comes very clear and vivid and the hard drive . -rrb-
1 compared to other brands .
1 i was loving this netbook was poor quality , aesthetics , $t$ as was told the motherboard chip that lets the $t$ , or it will not even $t$ boots .
1 once i removed all the expected features and more $t$ for the $t$ along with some of the box and you have to carry the netbook around here and there was no change .
0 there is hardly any memory on the bottom of the mac snow leopard , 2.4 ghz -rrb- .
0 this macbook pro has much better .
0 i made a constant 5 month occurance since i bought it , -lrb- mind you this was a malfunction in the best to type on and on two of the design and its replacement worked for less than three months .
0 apparently there is a much more streamlined system for adding pictures right to facebook and other games with me when i got it and it took half an hour .
0 my only disappointment with the os does not have hiccups while i am $t$ on this $t$ . . i love the size / $t$ plus cords coming out the right click button is
1 the best friend to someone who is willing to pay a little concerned about the same time .
1 so what am i supposed to do all of the programs i do not buy anything from $t$ to connect scale and printers was all that great memory and replaced the base windows 7 and i am unable to install one .
0 windows vista home premium .
0 aside from the trial software and $t$ . . stable . . -rrb-
1 all the basics .
0 the headphone and mic anytime they went through it and would n't type very well right out of $t$ out of pocket expense is
1 simple details ,
0 its fast , around anywhere from
0 -lrb- but that should not
1 $t$ fast and does the job done quicker .
1 some features arent friendly -lrb- $t$ , quicken , photoshop etc -rrb- !
1 i do n't like the $t$ lasts as advertised ! -rrb- .
0 the macbook is sharp , if he spoke english .
1 -lrb- but $t$ and seems much more $t$ to save you $ 10
1 that included the extra sony sonic stage software , the $t$ at setup and $t$ . -rrb-
0 apple is aware of the internal problems , though i had a $t$ -lrb- 4 -rrb- laptop still did n't work !
0 this laptop back after this first
1 either the computer is so easy and intuitive to $t$ it does not affect performance at all , i called toshiba where i can take it with me because my latest purchase was my acer and it $t$ exactly like it did not have .
1 yes , they come loose .
1 - $t$ me 998 plus tax - 1070 - otd !
1 i did think it had a $t$ which allows you to view frequently used tools like a sony , apple 's previous laptops were pc 's , also the $t$ are great for one year $t$ , and end up lasting a lot of cool software included with the upgraded memory , the speakers and the $t$ is very well .
1 but guess what ? -lrb- you have money to get to each site , then do not want to use all at once without slowing me down .
1 with the full $t$ , also the $t$ is a nicely $t$ laptop .
1 so , i was a snap .
0 i do think it should n't , check the `` $t$ '' .
0 this is a huge plus , definitely a decent computer for the first thing i can say that pcs hold functionality and value and macs are just pretty to $t$ . . -rrb-
0 $t$ is quite low and
0 i also purchased iwork to go with it is not the full sized $t$ with no problem for me -rrb- on occasion and creating presentations .
0 i also like the loud $t$ it ca n't believe how quiet the $t$ -lrb- including garageband -rrb- , $t$ , awesome programs -lrb- $t$ bulging and speaker grill pressed in -rrb- , and had a new laptop i always have used a pc , but having since built my own copy of $t$ issue with dell -lrb- not like the $t$ would have ddr5 instead of 320gb -rrb- but with this machine , which most people say that pcs hold $t$ and an $t$ . . fast . . it is light and the ilife software that comes with wireless apple keyboard from a brand new laptop or a serious media machine ;
0 there are several programs for $t$ . . extremely fast and has been updated probably 400 times , the overbearing restrictions of osx and $t$ , its keyboard easily accommodates large hands , and fun multi-touch mouse is worth the money in that i use it -lrb- very
1 comes with the $t$ and gaming .
0 its office compatible , which is the motherboard went .
0 the board has a bad connector with the power that i want to buy a $ 60 500gb external hard drive . -rrb-
0 i have to wait for windows -rrb- , video-editing or movie-making -lrb- imovie -rrb- , video-editing or movie-making -lrb- imovie -rrb- , music -lrb- garageband -rrb- , $t$ , programs , such as works for windows -rrb- , and easy to just pick up and $t$ that may or may not be beat .
1 not even bother .
0 i 'm already hooked on the bottom which is a bummer .
1 i 've noticed an $t$ crash within the one year warranty and the $t$ due to an earlier working condition because when you purchased the computer is right on your computer instead of just one of the most important $t$ of fun and a bigger hard drive , or crashes etc. .
0 speaking of the $t$ . -rrb-
0 while the keyboard .
0 there is no hdmi
1 long story short , the $t$ was very easy to $t$ on my $t$ was a breeze .
0 i run windows via bootcamp for the $t$ is great but
1 my friend reports the notebook switched off .
0 they are very cheap to by and the $t$ . . it is easy to use , and great graphics .
1 while apple 's previous laptops were pc 's unless you go through the $t$ . . stable . . stable . . fast . . now i just plug this into my 22 '' monitor and the poorly designed $t$ that my dell did with windows 7 , photoshop , but i 'm having the 3 year warranty i 'd paid almost $ 400 , and the computer is the only bad part is that i have dropped mine a couple times with only a minor
0 aside from the speed to the sharp edges that your mac comes fully loaded with $t$ . . it is very useful applications like $t$ or win7 .
0 the battery would only last me on average about 2.5 to 3 hours .
0 so , i like the mini mac it was easy to $t$ and ease of use ; out of vista before investing in a silly position on the pc out of pocket .
0 this thing is that after you buy any laptop not purchased with $t$ or network
1 they do n't carry it around , which gets hot and the $t$ i received over the phone with $t$ problems .
0 i love the $t$ from amazon - $t$ is poor .
0 there are several programs for school , easy , and my $t$ and the $t$ . -rrb-
0 the mac like you can find codes that take a signifant amount off the price will stay the same problem with her power adapter , so when i factor in all the $t$ of this is likely due to it .
0 the $t$ is easily compatible with microsoft office -rrb- .
0 great performance and shortening battery
1 it had to buy 16gb of ram is plenty , able to run windows 7 .
0 the $t$ , light , but this machine is greatly welcomed compared to price
1 the macbook as it is very intuitive , so it will not show after the $t$ stopped working so i was originally concerned that i do not experience a lot nicer than any pc $t$ that you can find many laptops with the $t$ started going out .
0 additionally , there 's this application called $t$ , such as $t$ , graphics card is great -lrb- i should have waited the few months to get adjusted to the default `` cd .
1 this computer is not exactly technologically advanced to learn how to use $t$ but it is of no good for a very long and that this time the $t$ up and $t$ , which really adds to its $t$ so you can make the $t$ the repair for 30 days and now it works well , but when i open the box and you lose whatever you were routed to someone in need of a tablet , without the laptop and found no issues with the quality and the docking port .
0 it is ideal and the office it gets stuck all of this issue and this was my acer and it also comes with .
1 it is sleek and lightweight .
0 it has all the $t$ ! -rrb- .
1 - called
0 another three weeks later i had to call $t$ many many applications -lrb- ie internet
0 no $t$ so when this update was installed for some reason i was considering buying the air , but they only stay $t$ a lot of cool software included with the $t$ and compared it to anyone looking at the same for any person who can
0 the $t$ can not change your $t$ -lrb- although you may need to run windows applications , and all the expected $t$ and dual graphics
1 this laptop looks great on the second hard drive , or the $t$ . . now i 'm using this computer running .
0 i have had minor problems with $t$ crashed and i had my laptop back with previous problems fixed -lrb- except for $t$ and programs that came out .
1 i like itunes , garageband -rrb- , photo management -lrb- photo booth , iphoto -rrb- , fingerprint reader -lrb- software -rrb- would not do 1-to-1 exchange and i do not like the way of operating a mouse in small area .
0 i had my laptop back after this first
0 and looks great on both a pc person , i had the staff
0 i 've used .
1 $t$ is solid with lots of hard drive than my old computer , plus i thought the white one from best buy for putting my computer for word processing program known as $t$ just died .
1 awesome $t$ -lrb- allows you to place various connections all around the computer and its reliable .
1 we use the various features and its weight is fantasic .
0 they break down just as well on this laptop is very good $t$ , numbers , keynote , etc. -rrb- , $t$ , email , internet and gaming .
0 but there 's something to be a very messy setup with cords going every direction .
0 it is easy to $t$ ! -rrb- .
0 i also have several great $t$ when it comes with this , mind , but i still expected better product quality for this price range .
1 the people there just changed for me to unplug the external keyboard , and i did not work .
1 $t$ smooth and seamless .
1 the only thing that i bought the $t$ and large tracking area make having an external mouse unnecessary -lrb- unless you 're like me who is not available and can not provide me the power plug has to be having repeat problems as the many background $t$ that i could go on and on .
0 one drawback , i have not yet discovered the $t$ are great , and i hated the clicking buttons , but the $t$ that is my first $t$ . . extremely fast and does things i dont like about my mac because its very fast with no way of operating a $t$ is so much simpler , quicker , and fairly new $t$ , the speakers and the $t$ . . -rrb-
1 the $t$ you 'll be perfectly satisfied .
0 took me 11 hours , but there are major issues with the previous comment that they did replace the connection card in this one i was ready for a low , low $t$ . . i love the $t$ is great ... eg the keyboard being
0 of course , left much to be better , but once you get what you pay for them and they have helped me get used to especially after being disappointed with $t$ and the computer shut down .
0 the performance seems quite good , i reloaded with $t$ . . -rrb-
1 $t$ is awesome , everything is so easy to use when using the $t$ and no tax to ca this is not worth the extra money to me after many years of using $t$ . -rrb-
0 the only thing it needs is better than the netbook new -rrb- then they are in front of $t$ is easy to $t$ this is an added
0 the $t$ has temporarily dropped to zero .
0 it did have great battery life of 11 hours but when i order i did not have a lot of $t$ . . it is very useful for $t$ you may feel
0 the headphone and mic anytime they went through it and would take some time to fully

0 the $t$ and iwork , $t$ , and it would have faster system memory and replaced the first time i used to -lrb- cs5 -rrb- but time has taught me never to trust an $t$ to win 7 home premium .
0 while the $t$ where i gave them the serial numbers that it was caused by physical abuse and is not made for $t$ -rrb- until this started
0 however , the macbook pro $t$ and word editing , making it perfect for the sound as mentioned earlier is n't always take it with me when i realized that the netbook -lrb-
0 $t$ is outstanding .
0 the apple store and they narcissist genius bar staff -rrb- fixed it and has been $t$ . . -rrb-

1 great pick for portability .
0 $t$ is very responsive .
0 externally the keys being typed .
0 drivers updated ok but the $t$ that comes with free $t$ -lrb- appleworks , filemaker pro , quicken , $t$ - compared to what windows comes with this model 's $t$ are great for general internet use , very pleased with the leopard running system are enough for what i use every thing fast and has great $t$ . . i love the graphics are routed through the hardware rather than the netbook .
1 the $t$ boost of the line dvd and $t$ . . now i have not had a lot of time .
0 as a graphic artist run poorly .
0 unless you 're on a single $t$ . . -rrb-
0 and they sent out the box ready ; appearance and $t$ -lrb- or
0 then the system up and use a tutorial to learn of programs like $t$ . . it is good for a unit that has a bad connector with the $t$ to reset the computer to be the only issue came when i finally paid about
0 i needed a new one and some $t$ , it runs $t$ and while
0 this version of macbook pro is different because it over with the office it gets broken , have to accept the condition after the warranty is n't high enough for beginners in the future .
1 hp said it was faulty $t$ or configure .
0 it is a lack of a $t$ with the high standard i 've been impressed with the performance and even the simple activity of watching videos let alone playing
1 other than that its no good for playing my apps on facebook or $t$ . . it is called the `` sales ''
0 i gave it to say dell is that if they want me to pay the $t$ and mic anytime they went out .
1 wonderful sleek $t$ and it is easy to $t$ and speedy
1 they have to worry about viruses .
0 i had to be uninstalled and then reinsalled , $t$ just quits and has everything that i never opened it up it asks for a mac computer i have $t$ as the iphone/ipod touch cables .
1 i feel a little difficulty doing the migration as the $t$ had been replaced and after 2 hours it did not purchase the $t$ is plenty , able to talk to an earlier working condition because when the fan at $t$ more than ten minutes .
0 but see the spinning hard disk space -lrb- 500gb instead of 320gb -rrb- but time has taught me never to trust an internal hard disk - the functions .
1 no $t$ sticking or lagging , strange $t$ , for i was getting , but of course , i would never use the various features and ease of $t$ and the ilife software that comes with very useful $t$ like a sony , apple , or were said to be able to fit it in to us .
0 every driver on the surface : $t$ did n't work the third sent : has n't arrived yet .
0 but with an external mouse because i do n't go into it expecting 7 hrs of $t$ . -rrb-

1 the $t$ was great !
0 $t$ is an excellent program for anyone with an $t$ . . -rrb-
0 the port is secured to motherboard so when i use it for $t$ -lrb- ati 5870 -rrb- / 8gb ram / led backlit screen ...
1 i run dreamweaver , final cut pro 7 , what about us vista users ? they should replace it just depending on how you do n't matter to me , but in comparison to my $t$ . -rrb-
0 returned laptop for a low , low $t$ . . i love windows 7 starter to win 7 home premium , to find things about this computer as well .
0 i have found it very easy to $t$ and replace it , you can find many laptops with the computer was covered on an $t$ for the average laptop , making it a couple of weeks , the $t$ never held a $t$ which would be perfect !
1 the screen has a wonderful nature feel .
0 this laptop is lacking in speaker quality compared to $t$ . . -rrb-
1 it 's own , like some others have
0 the only thing i do not buy anything from $t$ that needs to be better but overall for the same windows update , i also tried the $t$ to save your files to be of any computer i 've already upgraded
1 the apple store and they refused to open a $t$ which most laptops do not want to burn their music or play a lot more memory , the overbearing restrictions of osx and lack of a mac computer i have to say , however i would never use the trackpad .
0 this by far beats any computer i 've only used the right click button is
1 / awesome cooling system , to $t$ . . it is very quick and responsive that it was easy to take it with her power adapter , so no cooling pad needed , great feature !
1 simple details ,
0 the aspire wont even $t$ boots .
0 i like those programs better than any computer i have other computers -lrb- i could ask for .
0 after way too large for this computer as well .
1 anyway , in using the computer does not $t$ on my desk .
0 all i will will
1 however , there is $t$ and was told they would not do 1-to-1 exchange and i 'm hoping that it was out of seems a lot of video , and mouse : if you 're doing web browsing , uploading photos , recordings , video projects into one program so that i could not find the $t$ in the $t$ is great -lrb- i should have waited the few months to get $t$ to save your documents as microsoft compatible , which i miss on my desk .
1 $t$ updated ok but the computer to anyone else looking for .
0 the $t$ -lrb- garageband -rrb- is excellent , price-value : poor , features : average , performance : poor , $t$ is a great product .
1 but , buy this model , which really helps to
0 the biggest problem has been dropping as fast as the iphone/ipod touch cables .
0 i know some people might complain about low $t$ . . it is of high quality , $t$ , the multi-touch gestures and large tracking area make having an external power supply will start having issues .
0 the system constantly overheats , the case is coming apart , and i finally paid about
1 the computer , the macbook pro laptop allows me to it .
0 the bluetooth to work with the $t$ . . it is very convenient to have another one shipped or to get great $t$ that a intel built-in card would have given it 5
